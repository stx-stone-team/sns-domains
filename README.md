## 🌟 **Introduction**
Welcome to the **SNS (Stone Name Service) Domain Registration Application**, an innovative and user-friendly platform built on the **Stacks Blockchain**. This application empowers users to seamlessly search, and register domains with .stone and .stxstone extensions in a fully decentralized ecosystem.

Our platform leverages Next.js for its robust server-side rendering capabilities, providing an efficient and lightning-fast user experience. It also integrates Stacks.js for secure interaction with the blockchain, enabling users to register their domains through a simple, intuitive interface.

With the SNS platform, we aim to make decentralized domain ownership accessible to everyone. Whether you're registering a domain for personal branding, a business project, or digital identity, SNS ensures your registration is secure, transparent, and future-proof on the Stacks blockchain.
